n "The hallways were mostly empty, but the grounds outdoors tells a different story. Groups of students gather near the entranceways, walk together on the paths, and talk on their phones."

n "It's a surprisingly social place, a common area for students to unwind after a day of stuffy classrooms."

n "Come to think of it, if any of these students were like me for a time, I bet they'd crave a few minutes of the outdoors."

n "Not being allowed to leave your room just to get some fresh air felt like a part of you was stripped away."

n "When I was able to get out of the hospital, fresh air felt like a luxury. I'm sure other students would feel the same way."

n "Okay, simple enough."

n "\"Use the new verb conjugations we learned this week to write your essay.\""
