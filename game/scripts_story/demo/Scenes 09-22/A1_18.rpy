n "Hours later, I'm holed up in my dorm room, buried in physics equations."
n "It's amazing how fast this stuff piles up. Two nights ago, I was wondering how I would ever pass the time. Here's my answer, I guess."
n "I scratch the last answer down on the bottom of the notebook page and sit back in the chair."
n "45?"
n "It's wrong. It's definitely wrong. But it's also the last problem of the night and I can't convince myself to work the numbers again."
n "I close the notebook with a satisfying thump, happy enough to be done with the work, compromise or no."
n "Coasting through material like this probably shouldn’t be so easy, but being the new kid surely gives me some leeway."
n "Surely."

n "Class the next day is rather uneventful. Most periods are taken up by lecture time except for a small class discussion in philosophy."
n "I'm awake through all of them, at least. I slept better last night. Still woke up early – and didn't watch the sunrise with any pretty girls, but I still think it's an improvement."
n "At the very least, let's call it an even trade."
