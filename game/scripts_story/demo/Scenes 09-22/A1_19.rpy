n "Two days haven’t been enough to orient me and my afternoon philosophy class does little to help. In other circumstances I might be engaged or, at least, indifferent."
n "As it stands I’m just cynical about it all. Today it’s metaphysics and I can’t for the life of me understand why I should care about \“the underlying ontology of the world\""
n "I’m still struggling to grapple with the reality that I’m at a school for messed-up kids. I don’t have a nicer way to put it, not right now."
n "Maybe that’s on me, but I’m sorry Mr. Kronenberg; as far as I’m concerned Cartesian metaphysics has aged about as well as you have. The ivory tower can lock me out for all I care."
n "Every corner I turn seems to greet me with some mishap or another; just one more awkward experience of trying to be normal at a place that essentially isn’t."
n "If there’s anything I should be learning, it’s how to live with that - how to live with myself and with everyone else. Anything I thought I knew before St. Dymphna’s has long gone out the window and I’m looking for the skills I need to replace."
n "And they’ve put me here to study damn philosophy. Unless a fountain of practical, social wisdom is about to burst from underneath Kronenberg’s magnificent beard, I couldn’t care less."
n "Maybe the day will come when I can sit down and actually engage with whichever dead person it is we’ve moved on to, but that will have to wait. I have more pressing matters at the moment."
n "This is just something to survive for now."
n "Ironic, that."

n "Well, I did it."
n "I survived ninety minutes of philosophy."
n "I’d feel guilty for thinking of it that way if I wasn’t too busy being anxious about everything else. All I can do is put it behind me and look forward."
n "Speaking of, I haven’t given thought to my afternoon plans. My only obligation is to meet with Dr. Faber, and that leaves me with many unblocked hours."

n "The meeting."
n "It’s been looming in my head like some ominous spectre I can feel watching me from the corner of the room."
n "On the one hand I realise how silly that is: if anyone’s going to help me it’s the doctor. That’s why I’m here, after all."
n "Looking at it in those terms, I should be eager to see him. If this is going to work out, then every appointment is cause for excitement."

n "In between my thoughts I’ve found my way to the greenery outside. It’s a natural locus of attraction for all the obvious reasons."
n "Meticulously maintained grass, the gentle breeze, and a sky so clean and clear you could lose yourself in it for hours at a time. It’s hard not to love."
n "St. Dymphna’s is unnerving in many ways, but the scenery almost makes up for it. I could see myself spending more of my time outside than in my own room."
n "And, as I’m sure I’ll be told later, that’s probably better for my own mental health. You aren’t supposed to hole yourself up in a bedroom, as tempting as that’s been as of late."
n "I’m sure I’ll be told many things I’ll have to start keeping track of. A list they give me when I come here so that I won’t need to be here anymore."

n "Down one of the paths I notice the school chapel, its towering spire reaching into the heavens. It’s framed rather nicely by a set of flowerbeds and exudes a comforting, protective aura."
n "Didn’t Katja mention singing in the chapel? It was a comment almost in passing, but it would be worth stopping by to see if she’s there."
n "I’ve only heard her humming and even that was impressive. I can only imagine what her full singing voice sounds like."
n "In the worst case I’ll get to admire the chapel interior even if she isn’t there. Seems like a win-win."

n "It’s really quite pretty up close. I can’t say I feel a particular religious fervour  - I’ve never had strong feelings in any direction there - but the architecture is admirable in its own right."
n "More than anything it’s {i}imposing{/i}. I suppose the intent is to humble visitors to the house of God. For my part, it’s doing a decent job of that."
n "And… is that a distant sound of singing I hear?"
n "I guess I came at the right time to catch Katja."

n "I step up to the entrance and the voice grows unmistakably into Katja’s soprano. I can’t make out most of the details through the muffling wall between us but even from here I can tell: she’s good."

n "It’s even more impressive from the inside. It isn’t exactly huge, like I’d expect from a full-fledged cathedral or a church, but the chapel is clearly designed to evoke awe."
n "My religious indifference does little to subtract from what I feel being in a place made with such weighty emotions in mind. Whatever someone believes, they’d be hard-pressed not to feel respect for this solemn construction."
n "The steep windows illuminate the interior in bright, sharp relief. The ceiling climbs impossibly high and seems to almost disappear into itself. The pews, one after the next, fill themselves with images of worshippers even when there are none to be seen. It’s all so {i}inspired{/i}."
n "And that’s to say nothing of the music. Katja’s voice is bouncing off all the angles inside the hall and it feels like she’s surrounding me, singing from all sides."
n "The acoustics are remarkable and, honestly, disorienting. I find my eyes scanning all the walls even though I know Katja can’t be there. The noise pulls my gaze in every other direction before I finally looking down to the stage at the end of the hall."
n "And there she is."

n "This Katja is unlike the Katja I’d spoken to these past two days. To say that she’s different would do her an injustice."
n "She {i}transcends{/i} the Katja of yesterday."
n "Her body is flowing with the song and her every movement drips with feeling. As I walk closer I can see that her eyes are closed from concentration - but her lips are turned up into the faintest of smiles."
n "She isn’t just enjoying herself; she’s losing herself to the music."
n "I find myself doing the same with how exceptional her voice is. I can barely break my stare to slip into a pew and I’m immediately looking back at her, entranced."
n "The sounds come like a warm embrace and I can practically feel each word making its way through me."
n "She’s singing in an unfamiliar language, but it doesn’t matter. I can understand everything I need to know from the way she sings it. Katja’s masterful control of intonation is enough to convey the emotion in her words, and I say that hardly knowing what intonation {i}is{/i}."
n "And I can’t believe the same measured, cordial Katja of yesterday is producing so powerful a sound. Whatever she had shown me of herself, it bore no hints of this."
n "But I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised."
n "Anyone who has a passion is completely different when they’re engrossed in it. That’s what makes it a passion."
n "Watching her now, there’s no question that singing is Katja’s passion. It’s only been a couple minutes and I can already tell how important it is to her."
n "If she’d told me yesterday that I’d be having these thoughts now I might not have believed her. I might have thought she was lying or making fun of me. That mild-mannered girl doing something so intense, so emotional?"
n "It seemed impossible then."
n "If you told me now that Katja could get by without singing, though, I’d call you a liar. She’s giving so much of herself to this performance that if you took it from her, you’d take a piece of her with it. Even I can tell that much."
n "I’m more than happy to sit through the rest of this. It’s is just what I need after a third day that didn’t go much better than the last."
n "I close my eyes and lean back, giving all my attention to Katja’s voice."
n "The song rises and falls, it ebbs and flows, and at some point I stop thinking about it. Katja’s reduced it to pure emotion."
n "I can only imagine how much she feels to be able to sing like this."

n "With that, she’s off. Her shoes tapping on the ground and echoing around the hall remind me of the performance I’d just seen and I think again of the stark dichotomy between singing Katja and chatting Katja. I guess I’ll grow used to it in time."
n "I still have some time before my appointment with Dr. Faber so I decide to give the chapel a more thorough look. Distracted as I was with Katja earlier, it’s only now that I notice some of the details."
n "The windows aren’t just impressively tall: they’re also filled with intricate stained-glass artwork. Here and there I can recognise the images as representing Biblical figures, but even those that look unfamiliar are rather beautiful."
n "I’m reminded of all the nursery rhymes and childhood hymns. They were surprisingly effective at teaching me what I never had the interest to learn by reading."
n "I suppose that’s what they call an \"oral tradition\"."
n "I also realise that behind the stage, obscured somewhat by shadows, a gargantuan array of pipes reach up most of the way to the ceiling. A chapel is incomplete without a pipe organ, but I didn’t see it until now."
n "It occurs to me that Katja sings as part of a choir. Do they ever use instrumental accompaniment? More to the point, does Katja ever sing over the organ?"
n "She’s already impressive, but the thought of her voice over the brassy, booming pipes gives me goosebumps. I’d pay to see that."
n "Through my thoughts I hear footsteps approaching from an inside chamber at the side of the hall. Just as I’ve turned to look, a heavy door swings open with a creak and a congenial-looking elderly man steps through. "
n "From his attire it’s clear he’s some sort of priest. Like the organ, I should have expected his presence, but the thought never occurred to me."
n "He smiles at me across the pews and makes his way toward me."
oldpriest "I see you’ve met Ms. Böhm!"
n "His voice meanders around the hall with a comforting depth. It isn’t loud, but it’s stronger than I’d guessed from his narrow frame, and deeper too."
n "I can imagine what it would be like to listen to his sermons - reassuring, even if you’re not sure you understand his meaning."

fathermax "That said, Katja’s singing brings her here often."
fathermax "And it seems to have brought you here, too. I'm glad to see you're finding friends."
n "Are Katja and I really friends? I realise I don’t know what the boundaries of the word are. I’d be reluctant to apply it to us already, but if she said it were so I don’t think I’d object."
n "I guess we’re friends-ish. Friend-adjacent. Approximately friends."
erik "Something like that."

fathermax "I'm sure that with the nature of this school, you've found yourself thinking perhaps more than usual about your social interactions."
erik "Well…"
n "He's not wrong. But it's a bit embarrassing to admit, since those thoughts are usually of a more judgmental sort."

fathermax "It's quite alright, Erik. That was not an accusation. It's natural to tread more carefully in a place like this. Wise, even."

fathermax "In fact, I bring it up only to give my recommendations on the very same matter."
fathermax "You will of course be aware that, unfortunately, those with mental conditions of all sorts have to contend with a great deal of stigma. It can be overwhelming."
n "I shift a little at this. Until very recently I was responsible for some of that stigma. Even now, it's hard not to be on edge around some of my classmates."
n "If Father Max noticed my unease, he didn't respond to it."
fathermax "Given this, many of the students here have had to learn to put up appearances. It does not do to show your true self to every stranger when many of them have treated you poorly for it."
n "I'm reminded of the panic attack I had during Ela's tour. The way everyone just looked at me, and of how uncomfortable it was."
erik "Yeah. I get that."

fathermax "I expect you will also understand that as part of this facade, students often find that they need to effect a more stoic demeanour than they actually feel."
n "And now I'm reminded of how, right after the attack, I tried to put on a calm face for everyone else's sake."
erik "Yeah."

fathermax "You should not be surprised, then, if you find that people here appear to change as you grow close to them. Of course, they aren't changing; they're merely showing more of themselves to you. And you, in turn, will show more of yourself to them."
fathermax "More thoughts, more feelings, more sensitivities."
fathermax "What I want to suggest to you is that as these days come to pass, you'll find yourself treading as carefully as before. You'll still need to think before you speak."

fathermax "But where with strangers, you may not see the obstacles in your path, with friends, you'll know that the step you're taking is the right one. That is, if you've paid attention."
fathermax "And that is my advice to you, Erik: pay attention to the friends you make. They will need you as you will need them. When the time comes, you will know how to be there for them, if you've paid attention."
n "This sounds a bit much. I'm not socially inept—I know to listen to my friends. It's hard not to feel condescended to at Father Max's words."
n "But I guess guidance like this is exactly how a school of maladjusted kids is able to stay afloat. The little reminders to steer you in the right direction."
n "We all have our own triggers and preferences we have to keep in mind. Father Max is doing me a favour by putting that front and center in my head."
erik "I’ll keep that in mind, I appreciate it."

fathermax "This isn’t a warning, to be clear. I’ve just seen what careless ‘friends’ can do to a student. Everyone here deserves a brighter future than that."
n "Aha. There's the hint. However grandiose the Father's words may have been, he's saying them for Katja's sake specifically. He can't be obvious about it, but this isn't just generic teacher advice."
n "I feel like I understand his intentions better now. He's just looking out for his best singer. It's good that Katja's found someone she can rely on like that."
n "I might want to think about doing the same, in time. We’re nothing without our supports."
erik "Of course. I like to think I’m a decent friend, Father."
fathermax "I’m sure you are."
fathermax "For my part, I must be off."
n "He grins in good humour."

n "I’ll probably be fine, but just in case I get lost along the way, I decide to head there now. Better to arrive early with time to spare than be late to my very first meeting."
n "I take one final look around the chapel hall as I exit. I can still almost hear the faintest echoes of Katja’s voice."
