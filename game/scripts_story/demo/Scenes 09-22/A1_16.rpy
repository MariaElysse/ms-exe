n "Before I knew it, I had already wandered into the cafeteria."
n "Looking around, it’s still almost deserted barring a few early-risers shambling around with their food trays or shifting drowsily in their seats, but that didn’t make it any less lively than it was yesterday."
n "Some are happily chatting over coffee; some are hunched over piles of textbooks and notes; while a group in similarly designed tracksuits over there talks about what I figure to be strategies for some sport."
n "Looks like I’m the only one who’s alone right now."
n "I make my way to the counter. Being as early as it is, there’s still no queue to speak of, and the woman on the other side greets me with a perfectly-rehearsed spiel and a nice, small smile."
lunchlady "\"Good morning! What will you be having today, my dear?\""
n "I scan the counter for choices. I’m not particularly picky with food, so I guess it doesn’t really matter much as long as it’s filling enough. I ask for some pancakes, and a cup of café au lait to go with it."
n "It takes no more than a couple minutes before the server returns with my tray of food. I carefully lift it, only to nearly send its contents flying off when a cold, rasping voice breathes down my neck."
natalya "\"Доброе утро, Erik.\""
erik "\"WHOA!\""
n "I swivel around to face the source of the voice. What hellish beast could’ve produced that unearthly—"

erik "\"N-Natalya?\""
natalya "\"Helloooo. You look to be a bit surprised.\""
n "Natalya gives me a groggy smile, rubbing her eyes on her sleeve. Her hair is sticking out every which way like an unruly patch of crabgrass, eyes barely even half-open."
n "She’s carrying a few books and a notebook under her arm. Her shoulders are drooping, and her gait seems kind of unsteady."
n "The thought that she’s actually sleepwalking occurs to me. Her blazer isn’t even buttoned completely."
erik "\"G-Good morning.\""
erik "\"Not to sound rude, but, uh, shouldn’t you fix the buttons on your uniform, Natalya?\""

natalya "\"Ah, sorry. I, uh, didn’t notice. Still too sleepy . . . There, all tidy now.\""
n "I wanted to interject how little it improved since she otherwise still looked about as tidy as a Kansas farm freshly ravaged by an EF5 tornado, but I have a feeling she wouldn’t really care."
n "If I had any previous preconceptions of this girl being anything like a proper lady, those have now been blasted to kingdom come."
n "After she gets her breakfast of pancakes and orange juice, we walk over to the same corner of the cafeteria we hung out in yesterday, and take our seats."

erik "\"The rest of her face, I guess?\""
natalya "\"I wonder about this! Do you think we should investigate? Like Russian spy in action movies?\""
natalya "\"Since I’m Russian, I’m probably good spy, so I think it’s worth trying. Maybe Sofiya is already one, what do you think? Do you think we’ll need to ask her for help?\""
erik "\"... Speaking of her, she’s not here with you today, huh?\""

natalya "\"I know! That’s what I said to Sonechka! But she still told me to apologize.\""
erik "\"Well, water under the bridge, then. I’m not sure there was any harm done in the first place, but I appreciate the thought.\""
n "This seems to console Natalya."
n "She runs her fingers over her hair, a token attempt at grooming herself. She lets out a big yawn and stretches, which has the effect of disengaging the top button of her uniform yet again."
n "This time, she fixes it up more quickly, followed by a nearly inaudible groan."

erik "\"Wow, that’s very diligent of you!\""
n "Maybe I assumed too much from little interaction we had yesterday, but I didn’t think her the type to do that. That’s actually pretty admirable of her."
n "The remark, however, earns me a weird look from her.  She gives me a nervous smile, then scratches the back of her head with an off-sounding giggle."
n "An awkward silence falls between us. Her eyes begin flitting to and fro, sweeping the entire room, but not meeting mine. She idly drums her fingers on the pile of books beside her."
