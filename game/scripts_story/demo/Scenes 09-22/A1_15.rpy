n "I just keep turning around, waking up from nightmare after nightmare, gasping for air through a flood of childish worries and panic."
n "One time, I sat down to meet Dr. Faber and he told me I'm one of the worst cases he's ever seen and I'm never going to be able to function in society again."
n "In others, I woke up in the middle of a classroom filled with mocking, faceless students, to find that I'd had a seizure in front of everyone and wet myself and screamed something I can't remember."
n "It's probably just the stress. I'm still not used to sleeping in this bed, in this room, with this window and this closet and this ceiling, and it's been so long since I've had to fall asleep the night before a school day. It's not bad or scary so much as strange."
n "At least, it shouldn't be."
n "I think back to the e-mail I read before going to sleep. Dr. Faber wanting to have a meeting with me to \"get to know me better\". He's going to be my counsellor for the rest of the year, so I suppose it makes sense."
n "Yeah."
n "I'm going to have a regular, expert counsellor."
n "I'm going to meet him three times a week, and he's going to frown and nod and tell me to think logically about things while I tell him about my fears. That is, of course, assuming he doesn't just give up on me, like in my dreams."
n "Maybe this really is more than just what I'd like to think of as run-of-the-mill \"first week at a new boarding school\" kind of stress."
n "Still, one way or another, I need to get some rest. I don't want to make a bad impression before I've even really started my life here. Besides, I might miss something important if I go to my first real day of school tired."
n "I'm too sleepy to think properly, but by this point, I'm far too awake to go back to sleep. I just lie on my bed for a few more minutes, face still buried inside my pillow."
n "I'm really sweaty under the sheets. It's not very comfortable."

n "But what point is there to staying? I'm already done unpacking my stuff, I don't have any real homework right now, and even if I did, I'd be too tired to really handle it."
n "My head aches, and my mouth tastes of sleep despite having not gotten any. I'm sweaty, I'm smelly, and my hair probably looks like something a cat threw up."
n "First order of things should be taking a shower. I pick my glasses up from the nightstand, gather a new set of clothes and head out."
