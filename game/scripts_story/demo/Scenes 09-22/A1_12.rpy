lena "\"Good idea. Making small talk keeps your brain occupied and less susceptible to electromagnetic mind control.\""

erik "\"What idea would that be?\""

lena "\"That jokes would work better on an awkward silence than asking me about little things.\""

erik "\"Um. I guess, uh, what's that one that makes people swear a lot?\""

lena "\"Tourette's can do that. So can a frontal lobotomy, though.\""

erik "\"Why do you ask?\""

lena "\"I used to ask people what they're in here for but apparently that's 'insensitive', so I ask what their favourite disorder is. They usually pick something interesting like multiple personalities, when their actual thing is like agoraphobia or something generic.\""

n "Mental illnesses aren't like cars or flavours of ice cream. I don't think any well adjusted person would have one readily picked out."

lena "\"For me it's probably amnesia. It's pretty versatile.\""

lena "\"Basically, he's their last hope before they're sent somewhere else.\""

n "I'm not sure if Lena is trying to intentionally freak me out, or if she's always this blunt."

n "I was always under the impression that I'd only be seeing Dr. Faber a couple times before being assigned to someone else, or something like that. But for the whole year?"

erik "\"What are the other members like?\""

erik "\"Do you have some history with Fran? They ditched me at the club room as soon as she could.\""

lena "\"{i}They{/i} know not to mess with me, but aside from that, no. Fran used to date one of the members so they act like they're a full time member even though nothing they do gets published.\""

erik "\"Oh. So if I join, what kind of stuff would I be doing?\""

lena "\"Probably cleaning. It gets messier than you think. Does blood make you squeamish?\""

n "After looking through a pile of past newspapers, I'd say it looks doable. An activity here, an informal survey there; the school newspaper looks like a good balance between challenge and enjoyability."

n "Most importantly, it looks like a chance to keep active. Meet people. Go into town. Maybe travel when the choir goes on competition or something. Maybe if I go and join the outside world, I'll find a place to belong, even if that place is being nowhere in particular."
