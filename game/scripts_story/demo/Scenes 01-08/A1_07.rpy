n "A shaft of pale sunlight wakes me up from a shallow, restless sleep before my alarm. Despite the bright morning sun, my room feels chilly and I shiver in my thin pyjamas."

n "I wonder if it actually is chilly or if the endless cycle of negative thoughts in my head is just making me think it is."

n "You'd think the room would retain heat better what with the window being three times thicker than I'm used to, but it might as well be a hole in the wall."

n "Not even a day here, and that window's thickness is already bothering me. It's such a small detail I'm not even sure I'd have noticed it if it hadn't been pointed out, but now I just can't seem to stop thinking about it."
n "I roll out of bed and try opening it."

n "It's heavy, but it does open. Why wouldn't it? They said my room had been fitted for a low-risk student."

n "The air streaming in through the crack smells faintly of freshly cut grass and dew. It's numbingly cold, but I let it linger for a moment."

n "Just as much as having that window here in the first place feels stifling, knowing that it can be opened feels relatively comforting. A small measure of control over my life. Tiny and inconsequential, maybe, but it's something."

n "I take one final deep breath to clear my head and shut the window."

n "I stare at the screen until it turns off by itself, wondering what I should send in return. It did feel good to read – it's nice to know that she cares."

n "Despite it already being after seven, the male dorm courtyard is almost as empty right now as it was last night."

n "I thought there'd be a crowd of students moving in the general direction of the school, but far as I can see the few that are out seem content to sit on benches and chat. A few are even jogging around in tracksuits. Don't these guys have class in a little bit?"

n "I shuffle slowly through the courtyard, throwing the occasional glance this way and that to see if anyone looks like they're in any kind of hurry."

n "More and more students are leaving the dorms and they're all moving about here and there, but there's no prevailing direction to their movement. A few even acknowledge my presence, waving or smiling at me when I pass. I smile back and nod, but nothing much more than that."

n "Either I'm missing something about campus culture, or being late for first period is standard around here."

n "Actually, scratch that. It's probably just first day nerves on my part. The anxiety over getting to my first class on time is overbearing. Either way, I think I'd be better get moving. Wouldn't have anything to say to them anyway."

n "After deciding against eating in the crowded cafeteria and taking breakfast in the form of a vending machine cereal bar, I drift back into the lobby to see if I can remember the way to my form room."

n "As I enter, I feel a surge of relief as I see a familiar face for the first time that morning – a tutor, Ms. Claes. It looks as though she's waiting for someone, standing amidst a gaggle of other students and looking around."

n "Apparently she was waiting for me as when our eyes make contact she walks briskly in my direction, a stern expression on her face. The students instinctively part before her and merge back together in her wake. Surely I'm not already in trouble."

claes "\"Erik! I'm glad you found your way here. I wasn't sure if you'd have been shown the way, so I thought it best to wait for you here.\""

n "As we walk up a set of stairs I feel my palms start to sweat a little. I hadn't realised how nervous I was, but I honestly have no idea what to expect from this place."

n "I don't know what's going to be expected of me when we reach the form room. Will I have to introduce myself? The sharp clack-clack of Ms. Claes' heels echo against the stone walls, for some reason bringing the ticking of a time bomb to my mind."

n "As we reach the top of the stairs and enter another corridor, rather more clinical than the last, she seems to pick up on my nerves, cocking her head as she looks at me. Her expression softens somewhat."

claes "\"Nervous?\""

n "Despite her apparent concern, her voice remains quite harsh. I suppose I can forgive her; I wouldn't know how to behave in her shoes."

erik "\"Honestly, yeah.\""

claes "\"That's perfectly understandable. It's completely natural to feel nervous in new situations.\""

n "I can tell Ms. Claes is genuinely trying to reassure me but she isn't very good at it; it comes off feeling sort of forced and awkward."

claes "\"Especially in circumstances like these.\""

n "The room is about half the size of the classroom, painted in neutral, warm colors and dotted with small book shelves and tables."

n "A circle of chairs has been formed in the center of the classroom, some of the students have already taken seats, while a few are more content to choose seats outside of the circle."

n "There's a girl over there listening to music; is that allowed?"

n "I'd much rather take a seat at the edge and listen to music, but I guess it's not really an introduction if I'm as far away from anyone's attention as I can be."

n "I take a seat between two classmates, and wait until the rest of the class has found somewhere to sit."

n "..."

n "This process takes a lot longer than expected. A few students seem unsure as to where they want to sit, but Ms. Claes seems fine waiting for them."

n "..."

n "Once everyone is seated, Ms. Claes begins speaking."

claes "\"Okay everyone, as I said, we'll be holding an introduction for a new student today, so I'll explain the rules.\""

n "{i}Rules?{/i}"

n "Ms. Claes reaches for a shelf behind her, and retrieves a small pillow."

claes "\"This is the talking pillow, we'll be passing this around the circle. If you're holding the pillow, you can introduce yourself if you like, and if not, you can pass it along.\""

n "This has got to be the strangest introduction I've ever found myself in."

n "Is this the norm here?"

claes "\"I'll begin. I'm Ms. Claes, and I'll be your homeroom teacher. I've been teaching for many years, and my hobbies include reading and puzzles.\""

n "The class is quiet for a moment before Ms. Claes passes the pillow to her right. That student immediately passed it on again, apparently unwilling to introduce themselves."

student "\"Uh, Hi everyone, I'm Andre. I'm in the literature club, that's pretty much all I do.\""

n "Andre considers adding more, before passing the pillow on further."

n "We spend the next twenty minutes passing the pillow around the circle and introducing ourselves."

n "Some simply say their name, while some take the time to explain why their favorite food is their favorite."

n "It seems so... childish."

n "Before long the pillow is in my hands, and all eyes are on me."

n "They're not judging. Not mean, or expectant. Some are even bored."

erik "\"I'm Erik, I used to like hiking... geography too, I guess.\""

n "And just like that, my introduction is over."

n "Maybe I was hyping this up too much."

n "I pass the pillow to Fran. He likes steak and goes to the newspaper club."

n "He seems like a pretty nice guy, actually."

n "After a few more introductions, few of which I will remember, the pillow is handed back to Ms. Claes."

claes "\"Okay class, that was very good.\""

claes "\"We'll split into some smaller groups now.\""

n "More introductions?"

n "Ms. Claes splits us intro groups of four and encourages us to ask each other \"icebreaker questions,\" whatever those are."

n "I don't really get the point of all of this, but I guess I've got to play along."

n "Luckily one of the people in my group seems happy to talk about herself at length."

frauke "\"What about you, Erik?\""

erik "\"Huh? What was that, sorry?\""

frauke "\"What's your ideal job?\""
