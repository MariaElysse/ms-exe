him "\"Hey, see that ledge?\""

n "My gaze follows his finger to an outcrop jutting a few hundred metres out from the mountain's surface."

him "\"Remember the end of our last climb? That's our starting point now. Pretty cool, right?\""

me "\"Wow... We've come a long way, haven't we?\""

him "\"You bet. You've learned the ropes pretty quickly. At the pace we're going now, I'd say we'll be at our goal sometime in the afternoon.\""

me "\"Heh, just enough time to get back for dinner.\""

n "He claps me on the back, his grip firm and reassuring."

him "\"Now {i}that's{/i} what I'm talking about! C'mon, let's go.\""

him "\"Got everything packed?\""

me "\"Double and triple-checked! All weight accounted for.\""

me "\"Well, except breakfast.\""

n "He laughs."

him "\"Well, the more you eat...\""

me "\"...The less you have to carry!\""

n "I finish his sentence and confidently hop off the rock we've been sitting on, enjoying the solid {i}crunch{/i} the ground makes when I land. The shock from the landing helps balance the butterflies in my stomach."

n "Like last night's campfire, I feel a growing heat that radiates to my toes; the sensation eases my nerves."

n "{i}We've got this.{/i}"

n "In a single fluid motion, he finishes the rest of his pitch-black coffee and leaps down to join me."

him "\"All right, let's rumble. Got a long trek ahead of us.\""

me "\"Right behind you!\""

n "I adjust the straps on my backpack and set off down the trail with him."

him "\"Check your straps one last time. Wouldn't want to have to tell Mum that we came all this way, just for you to get a bruise from the gear.\""

me "\"Yup, I know. Double and triple-checked, remember?\""

him "\"{i}Juuuuuuuust{/i} making sure. Worrying's my job here, y'know. Unless you don't need me for this climb?\""

n "We both laugh; the sound bounces off the rocks and echoes in the valley - almost as if the mountain is laughing with us."

me "\"I'd prefer to keep you around, just in case.\""

n "We continue our ascent up the mountain. Gradually, the soil and grass give way to snow and stone."

him "\"Nervous?\""

me "\"A little.\""

him "\"It would be crazy if you weren't, dude. This {i}is{/i} dangerous stuff, you know.\""

him "\"The key thing is to remember that you can make that nervousness work for you, instead of the other way around.\""

him "\"Any-hey, you've got nothing to worry about while I'm here. I've got your back...\""

me "\"...And I've got yours!\""

n "He flashes his trademark grin."

him "\"That's a promise. Just focus on the climb and the goal at the top.\""

him "\"Now, I've got a proposition for you: you do everything right, we get to share some of my {i}special{/i} brew at the top. We do this like men. Deal?\""

me "\"Deal.\""

n "I try to slide to the edge of the bed, but my leg tangles in the sheets and I topple gracelessly to the ground."

n "This pressure makes it hard to move, and my vision is tunneling as I try - and fail - to catch my breath."

n "I inhale - or at least I try to."

n "Breathe out..."

n "I wheeze out as much as my panicked body allows and try to repeat the process."

n "My body is being crushed under its own weight as I breathe. I'm drenched in sweat now; it's draining out of me like water from a wrung sponge."

n "It's cold, but keeping warm is low on my list of priorities."

n "As the cool night air pushes in to meet my face, I inhale and gulp it down like it's the freshest thing I've tasted in years."

n "Yet this air is something I first encountered only a few hours ago, and the charming back-alley view only serves as a reminder of where I am."

n "Vienna, Austria."

n "It's not the most glamorous view of the city, but the fact that I  have my own room keeps me thankful."

n "My older sisters are hosting my parents and I for the weekend. It's something we all couldn't thank them enough for - even if it isn't the reunion any of us were expecting."

n "I should get back to bed. Maybe the cool air will help."

n "I bite my tongue in an attempt to derail that train of thought."

n "I shouldn't be like this. This is {i}not{/i} who I want to be."

erik "\"Yeah, I know.\""

n "I know they have the best intentions, at the very least. As for where that road leads... well, that isn't so certain."

n "What I {i}do{/i} know is that I'm incredibly exhausted and feeling more on edge than I have since the accident."

n "It feels like I'm being introduced to new sights, new smells, new {i}everything.{/i}"

n "I want to be excited, but all I can think of is how easily everything can go wrong. To me, anything could be a potential threat."

mum "\"I know it's been a rough few days, but you know we're here for you Erik. Always.\""
