n "I follow everyone back into the classroom as Ms. Claes had instructed, and attempt to find myself a seat."
# 
n "Most of the students around me, and all those directly adjacent to my desk, get up to move off to their next lesson. I remain where I am though – I have maths with Ms. Claes."
# 
n "The classroom quickly fills up with other students again. This time, it looks like the desk next to mine by the window might be occupied; a girl enters the classroom and makes a beeline right for it."

n "She regains her composure quickly, though, fixing back her resolutely neutral expression and taking her seat by the window without saying a word to me or, aside from the slight hesitation, acknowledging my existence at all."

n "The first thing that catches my eye about her is how little she catches my eye. Sitting still and staring out the window, oblivious to the rest of the class, wearing a hoodie rather than the standard blazer everyone else seems to wear. I wonder how she gets away with that?"

n "Despite being out of uniform, she almost blends into the wall. If she hadn't sat next to me, I doubt I would have noticed her at all."

n "She hasn't looked my way at all and the fancy-looking metallic earbuds in her ears make trying a verbal introduction seem foolish."

n "I'm not sure why I'm focussing on this girl over any of the other students in the class. Maybe her inconspicuousness makes her somehow more conspicuous?"

claes "\"Okay, so today we'll be reviewing the material we covered in the previous lesson. These worksheets...\""

n "She brandishes a sheaf of papers."

claes "\"... comprise a thorough test of it all. To be finished by the end of the lesson, please.\""

n "As she starts handing them down the class, she looks at me, an expression of realisation on her face."

n "Scanning the material on the sheet Ms. Claes has placed in front of me, it doesn't seem to be too challenging. Maths isn't exactly my forté, but this is relatively simple stuff. I might have missed the previous lesson but it's nothing I couldn't handle on my own."

n "Still, it wouldn't hurt to partner up, introduce myself, socialize a little bit. That would be the normal thing to do. Well, who knows what's normal here? Might as well try, though."

n "The girl next to me is still staring out the window, the muffled and tinny beat from her headphones bleeding into the room around her, barely audible to me over the noise of the class. Presumably in time with the music she's listening to, her fingers are drumming out a beat on the desk in front of her."

n "Actually, it looks more like someone playing an imaginary piano than imaginary drums. Her fingers appear spider-like, splayed across the desk."

n "If wonder if she's aware that she's doing that. She must be really into whatever she's listening to."

n "In my distraction, it seems like everyone else in the class has already partnered up or started the work themselves, leaving this girl as my only choice. Working with someone who seems so strongly not to want to be noticed probably isn't a good idea, and I'm sure I could take care of the relatively simple-looking worksheet by myself, but Ms. Claes did seem very keen for me to work with a partner."

n "I wonder if she'll even hear me if I talk to her."

erik "\"Hello.\""

n "You have to start with hello."

n "She turns her head in my direction though still doesn't face me properly, instead focussing on some spot on the wall behind me. It's not much, but at least she's noticed my presence and is no longer gazing absentmindedly out the window."

n "I can already feel that this is going to be difficult."

erik "\"I'm Erik.\""

n "In a daring move, I stretch out a hand in introduction."

n "Somehow she looks more surprised than before. Her eyebrows look like they're just about ready to fly off her face and she stares at her own hand as if it had committed some foul act of betrayal. Aside from in that one brief moment of shock, she still hasn't looked me in the eye."

n "I feel pretty bad for worrying her and try to think of a way to move the conversation past this."

n "Clearly noticing my attempt to move past my initial, horrific mistake, she turns in my direction again and smiles slightly haltingly, looking only a little less hesitant than before – but this time definitely and deliberately looking me in the eye."

n "Once again I notice the music faintly leaking out. It may be just that it's very faint, but I don't recognise it at all."

n "But then, from her bag, she pulls out the smartphone her headphones are connected to and shows me the screen. A music player open, I catch a glimpse of what she's listening to. I've never heard of the artist, and the album art – a photo of a couple of people sitting on a cliff by the sea – doesn't give anything away about the type of music."

n "Clearly, judging from her expression she understands the problem in communication as well. Nonetheless, her only response is to nod once and smile almost imperceptibly."

erik "\"You want to work on these together?\""

n "Without a word she nods one final time, takes a copy of the sheet from me, scans the second question for only a few seconds and starts scribbling nonchalantly on a page from her workbook. Doesn't exactly look like she's writing – her hand movements are weirdly erratic – but who am I to say?"

n "Seems like she's glad to have an excuse not to interact any more."

erik "\"Okay then...\""

n "Somehow, despite having done very little, I feel exhausted."

n "First period isn't even over yet. I sink into my chair, ready to admit defeat."
