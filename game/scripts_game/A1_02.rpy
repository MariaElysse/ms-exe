Voice "\"Hi there!\""

n "A girl is inches away from my face, cheerfully greeting me."

n "It's a face I know all too well."

erik "\"Morning Beatrice…\""

n "A tired mumble escapes me as I greet who most people assume to be my younger sister."

n "Beatrice, however, is my senior by a few years, exuding youth that belies her true age. She’s like a little kid, literally shaking with energy as she tries to pull me out of bed."

n "I'm not ready for this."

n "...Maybe I can reconsider."

erik "\"What's on the menu?\""

n "She winks at me."

beatrice "\"You'll have to get your butt out of bed and find out~\""

n "She whips the covers off my bed in one last-ditch effort for me to finally get up. Instinctively, I pull the covers back; Beatrice just pulls them off playfully again. It’s really not as funny as she seems to think it is."

erik "\"Okay, okay, you win. At least let me wash up first.\""

n "She cheers and proceeds to jump off my bed, dash out of my room, and run down the hallway announcing my eventual arrival."

n "With my covers at the end of the bed."

n "I guess it was the right choice to wear my pyjamas instead of going for a more ‘free’ option."

n "Thankfully my morning prep isn't too extensive. With just a rinsing of my face and a quick combing of my hair I’m all set for some breakfast."

hilda "\"I missed you. It’s great to see you up and about, Erik.\""

erik "\"I missed you too. I hate how every time I see you guys there has to be some reason behind it.\""

hilda "\"It’s understandable. Making a trip out to Vienna isn’t something you can do on a whim. If anything, it would be more feasible for us to come visit you.\""
