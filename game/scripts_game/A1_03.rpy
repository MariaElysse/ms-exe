n "There it is, the question I’ve been dreading ever since I got here."

n "It’s not like I wasn’t expecting this from her. She's never been one to dance around issues, even over the most minor things."

n "There's no use evading the question or brushing her off. I know that look in her eyes – she has to know, or it'll eat at her all day."

erik "\"Well, it's fine, I guess. It's still attached and all.\""

hilda "\"That's not what I meant! Is it still… numb?\""

n "I mean, I could go on about how it kept me up last night, or how it keeps reminding me of the accident, or how it sometimes decides to stop working entirely."

n "But I don't have the heart to tell her those things. I can't bear to make my family more upset at their broken Erik."

n "And it’s not like I don’t know why she asked that question. Her little brother going through something that she can't figure out or solve – it must be frustrating for her. Hell, it’s frustrating for me."

n "Right now, all I can do is reply with a simple answer."

erik "\"Simply put, yes, It's still pretty numb. Today it seems to be okay – enough to go around town with you and Beatrice, at least.\""

erik "\"But?\""

hilda "\"...Wouldn't it be better for you to work with a physical therapist back at home? What will a school do for you that a dedicated doctor can't?\""

n "Her question cuts to the heart of the conversation I'm pretty sure she’s wanted to have with me for a while. While in most cases she'd be correct, there's something else that's been driving my motivations to come here."
