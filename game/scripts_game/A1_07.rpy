n "We come to a stop in front of the large building that holds the offices."

irene "\"Well, looks like our little tour is over!\""

n "I’d like to be able to say ‘This tour has put me at ease’, but if anything it’s put me more on edge."

n "Sure, I didn’t see any padded walls or restraints, but I did see a student fall from a tree before talking about lipreading and nazi gold. Then there was that run in with Dr. Faber right after a panic attack."

n "My palms are sweaty just thinking about meeting him again."

n "Beatrice still looks like she’s off in her own world while Hilde seems to be feeling just as uneasy as I am."

n "Ela breaks the silence with a small cough before speaking."

ela "\"I should probably get back to work.\""

ela "\"It was nice meeting you Erik, give me a call if you need to know anything, Okay?\""

erik "\"Sure, thanks.\""

n "Ela leaves with a wave and a smile. I offer a half-hearted wave back, but it seems like she’s turned around by the time my hand is raised. Ah."

n "Irene snickers as she notices my half-hearted wave. Before leaving, she leans towards me conspiratorially."

irene "\"Let me know if you actually need info, she talks a big game but she doesn’t know the land like it do.\""

erik "\"Uh, right. Thanks.\""

n "Irene winks and spins on her heels just like Ela did before strutting off towards the forest."

n "Beatrice releases a small sigh as her new best friend walks away before turning her eyes to me."

n "Hilde offers an aggressive elbow into Beatrice’s side, almost knocking her off her feet. Thanks Bea."

hilde "\"Think you’ll get lost much?\""

erik "\"No doubt. I’m pretty sure they gave me a map in my welcome pack though.\""

hilde "\"Good. It looks like a very nice campus.\""

beatrice "\"Definitely nicer than mine.\""

beatrice "\"And the teachers are nicer too.\""

n "She punctuates her sentence with a drawn out sigh. I don’t think there’s a teacher on this planet that Beatrice could get along with."

hilde "\"Your lecturers are perfectly fine, it’s just that you keep arguing with them.\""

beatrice "\"Can you blame me with the amount of work they give out?\""

hilde "\"You’re a university student, what did you expect?\""

erik "\"Less homework, clearly.\""

beatrice "\"Yes! He understands!\""

n "This casual conversation is calming after the whirlwind that my tour turned out to be. I expected today to turn out very differently."

mom "\"Ah, we escaped!\""

n "Mom and Dad finally exit the large building and make their way over to us, a small folder of papers resting in Dad’s hands."

dad "\"He certainly had a lot to say about the school.\""

mom "\"That’s good! He’s passionate!\""

mom "\"And he’s going to make sure you get the best care possible, Erik.\""

erik "\"Right.\""

erik "\"Once I’m settled in I’ll feel a lot better.\""

mom "\"That’s great! How was your tour?\""

erik "\"It was... good. There’s a lot of places to see, I think I might go for a walk a little later on.\""

dad "\"Just be sure to be careful, It looks like the weather is going to get worse later on.\""

erik "\"There’s no such thing as bad weather, just inappropriate clothing.\""

n "…"

beatrice "\"Doesn’t Gustav say that all the time?\""

n "Mom and dad practically freeze at the mention of his name. Silence lingers in the air."

mom "\"...\""

dad "\"...\""

mom "\"Well I’m sure it will be a nice walk, Erik.\""

n "This time Hilda freezes, a sour look on her face."

hilda "\"Mom, If we keep ignoring it then you’re just wasting his time here.\""

n "That calming feeling is torn from my body almost as quick as it arrived. The last thing I wanted was for my family to fight about this."

mom "\"Oh, don’t worry about that, Erik. It’s going to be fantastic here, right?\""

n "Dad nods along with his usual deadpan expression. I guess that’s what being a financial analyst does to you."

n "Mom quickly checks her watch and launches into her goodbyes as thoroughly as possible."

n "She pulls me into a hug and almost breaks my ribs as she squeezes. Dad follows shortly after, though with a much more relaxed handshake."

mom "\"Well, we better be off. Make sure to relax a little, okay?\""

mom "\"You’ve got nothing to worry about here.\""

erik "\"... Okay.\""

n "Aside from the fact I’m in a school for the mentally impaired, who knows who could be waiting around the next corner."

mom "\"Alright, come on girls, let’s go and get some dinner before the restraunts close!\""

n "Her usual peppiness returns as the ‘Gustav’ issue is sidestepped completely."

hilde "\"Mom, come on.\""

beatrice "\"Oh, where do you wanna’ go?\""

n "In a matter of seconds Beatrice forgets what we were talking about. Hilde looks sour for a second, but folds to Mom’s overwhelming social power with a sigh."

hilde "\"Well then… Take care, Erik.\""

beatrice "\"We love you lots!\""

n "Both sisters move in for a hug, and then are quickly herded towards the car while Mom fusses over them."

n "And now I’m alone."
