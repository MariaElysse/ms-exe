ela "\"...This hallway houses most of the art and music rooms, where elective classes and after-hour clubs are held.\""

n "The buildings themselves are beautiful, but I can’t help but notice the additions - light filtering through huge windows with suspiciously thick glass, wide corridors dotted with emergency phone lines."

n "Ela makes no mention of the ‘preventative measures’ the brochures seemed so eager to promote."

n "If Hilda has caught on, she’s kept her mouth shut, mirroring my quiet concern. Beatrice, on the other hand, is in love with the place."

n "Ela leads us straight forward, pushing open larger-than-average double doors into the main building, central to the campus. Beatrice gasps audibly."

n "In front of us is a courtyard of awe-inspiring proportions, two matching staircases wrapping around the perimeter, framing a veritable park’s worth of foliage and benches, all contained under a domed glass ceiling several stories above us. Hallways branch from the center on the first and second floors."

ela "\"We call this is the atrium, which is fitting since it’s sort of the heart of the building. Most of the classrooms can be accessed from here, as well as the library.\""

ela "\"It can be a little noisy, but if that doesn’t bother you, it’s a very calming place to study or relax.\""

ela "\"So take it from someone who’s been in your shoes: St. D’s is just like us. It’s easy to put a label on it and jump to conclusions about it, but that’s not the whole package.\""

ela "\"Having a condition doesn’t change who you are, catering to those conditions doesn’t change what this is. It’s just a school.\""
