irene "\"So that building is probably the oldest, at least judging from the brickwork. There’s this one patch where the bricks are newer, but I can’t for the life of me figure out why.\""

erik "\"Maybe they renovated it?\""

n "Our unfortunate guide wrestles with herself before letting the comment go uncontested, but her expression is pretty informative nonetheless. Irene doesn’t seem to notice."

n "As we explore the more mundane aspects of the campus, ironically, I find myself relaxing more. Although Ela seemed concerned I might think badly of them, the truth is that my imagination had far worse ideas."

n "Really, it’s those small touches of personalization, imperfections, that make it feel... normal."

n "Eventually we wander away from the campus, Ela regaining the lead as we head towards the woods. Irene gives a minute shrug, but seems content to follow along. Before I have a chance to ask where we’re heading next, Ela slows to a halt."
