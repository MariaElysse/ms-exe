n "I watch my family as they get into the car and wave one last time. It still feels sort of unreal."

n "Get a hold of yourself, Erik. You’re a grown man."

n "As the car pulls away I take a deep breath and turn, making my way along the path that leads around the side of the school’s main building towards the dormitories."

n "When I get to the steps in front of the boy’s dorm I stop for a moment to take it in, squinting in the sun as I look up at the building."

n "It looks kind of gothic, like a haunted house. Or Hogwarts. Not the sort of place that people actually live in."

n "It’s home now."

n "I head inside."

scene dormhall
with Dissolve(2)

n "The corridor I find myself in has that familiar musty smell that this sort of place always has."

n "What is that? B.O.? Expired milk? Wet dog?"

n "I settle on a combination of all three."

n "Despite the very student-y smell, the place is clearly kept in good condition. Looks like the walls have been repainted recently and the carpet tiles are stain-free."

n "I make my way along the corridor, very aware of my echoing footsteps and the presence of the dorm’s potential inhabitants behind the hall’s many doors."

n "The flight of stairs up to the first floor tires me out more than I’d care to admit. After pausing for a second to catch my breath, I finally reach door number 101, open it, and stand for a moment in the doorway of the uninhabited room."

n "My room. Gotta think of it as my room now. Weird."

scene bedroom
with Dissolve(2)

n "Stepping inside, the door swings shut behind me."

n "I didn’t meet anyone between here and the main building, but hearing the sounds of the dormitory’s other inhabitants from outside the door makes me anxious, as if everyone else is somehow aware of my presence and might barge in and start interrogating me at any moment."

n "I feel like I should have some sort of responsibility at this point, but looking around the room I can’t think of anything I need to do."

n "Everything has already been put away - even the clothes from my suitcase."

n "I slump down onto my neatly-made bed and my gaze lands on a few papers on the bedside table. For lack of anything better to do I pick some up and rifle through them."

n "They aren’t anything very interesting."

n "A leaflet that I’ve already seen. It was mailed to us along with everything else a while ago."

n "Under that, a quaint newsletter that looks as though it’s put together by the students. Nothing too surprising here either, though there are a few pages dedicated to advertising the school’s apparently numerous clubs that catch my attention. Cooking, knitting, anime, track, gaming... Potholing. Bomb construction."

n "Okay, I might have made the last couple up. Still, it sounds like there’s plenty of interesting stuff to do. Maybe I’ll check some of them out at some point. Might as well make the most out of my time here, though I doubt I’ll be running on the track team any time soon."

n "A schedule of upcoming events is next, followed by a map of the grounds - though I already have one of those."

n "Finally, to my surprise, a personal timetable with all my classes. I’d expected that I would’ve had to pick that up in homeroom tomorrow or something. They must really look after you here."

n "All it serves to do is to remind me of what kind of place this is."

n "The timetable tells me that dinner isn’t served until 6pm. Glancing at the clock next to my bed I see I have some time to kill, but no idea how to kill it."

n "For a moment, I consider calling Ela. I mean, she said I could if I needed to."

n "Though... it has only been half an hour. Would that be weird?"

n "It would definitely be weird. I’m at a loss."

n "I look to the laptop set up for me on the desk in the corner. The internet is tempting."

n "But no - I have a whole new school to explore! I mean, I may have only just been given the tour, but who knows what I could find on my own? Looks like it’s time for that walk I pretended to want to go on earlier."

n "Feeling somehow self-conscious about leaving my room less than a minute after I entered it, I head back out."

scene outsidemaledorm
with Dissolve(2)

n "It’s only as I get outside that I realise I left the map behind."

n "Time to find out how much of the tour I remember."

n "The air outside is bracing and autumnal and I inhale it deeply. The forest surrounding the school gives the air a fresh, invigorating smell and the constant whispering of the trees in the slight wind is welcomely calming."

n "There are still a few hours of daylight left, but the shadow cast by the building behind me is growing long."

n "I look across the shadowed lawn to the dormitory opposite."

n "The girls’ dorm. Despite being almost identical to the boys’ it exudes an ethereal quality. What wonders lie within?"

n "I doubt I’ll find out any time soon. Besides, I’m sure there’s some sort of draconian limitation on male access to the place."

n "After all, everybody knows as soon as a man gets within fifty feet of a woman he completely loses control of himself."

n "Nevertheless I decide to head in that direction, thinking I’ll roughly follow the treeline to my left that borders the grounds. I make my way across the lawn between the two dormitories."

scene outsidefemaledorm
with Dissolve(2)

n "In the centre of the lawn are a few benches and a small fountain, whose single lacklustre spout dribbles unimpressively. It pales in comparison to the spectacular water feature in front of the main building - the one the parents see. I wonder how often the students actually congregate here, if ever."

n "As I pass, a few pigeons that I hadn’t noticed pecking around on the floor take flight, rushing into the air towards the forest. My gaze following the birds, I lose sight of them as they vanish beyond the forest’s border. It must be nice to be able to just take flight like that and disappear whenever you want."

n "I wander aimlessly in the direction of the building ahead. I guess when I reach it I’ll just bump off the wall, turn a little bit and keep walking in a straight line until it happens again. Like a Roomba."

n "As I approach the dormitory I feel a great disturbance in the air, as if a cute girl felt a great rage well up inside her that was suddenly silenced."

n "The feeling sends a chill down my spine. Right on cue, the building’s double doors swing open, drawing my attention to the girl emerging from them."

n "Irene. She seems to be in very high spirits. She spots me almost immediately and jogs over across the grass almost skipping in excitement, grinning broadly."
